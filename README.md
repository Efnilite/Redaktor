Redaktor is a tool that will provide you the basics of world editing. This plugin is very useful in small projects, if you don't want to use something like WorldEdit. WorldEdit does have a way larger API, but it has a lot of features that you probably won't use if you just want to paste schematics or set a few blocks.

Every class in Redaktor, no matter how important it is, has been fully documented with javadocs (available here). This makes it perfect as an API since you just have to go to the javadocs, find your class and method, and it's fully explained how it works and what it does.

Redaktor also has a player side. It features commands which can be used by the console and the players. These commands make it possible for your players to also get the maximum out of Redaktor's API.
